##  1. Generating random variables:  
- p{distr} generates a cdf; 
- d{distr} generates a pdf/pmf
- q{distr} generates quantiles
- r{distr} generates a sample
   
Here **{distr}** can be any distribution:  

- norm (normal)  
- exp  (exponential)  
- unif (uniform)  
- gamma (gamma)  
- chisq (chi-square)  
- binom (binomial)  
- geom  (geometric)  
- pois  (Poisson)  
    

## 2. Example: plotting exponential distribution

```{r}
z <- seq(0,2,by=0.01); length(z)
plot(z,pexp(z, rate = 2), 
     col="purple", 
     ylim = c(0,2), 
     ylab = "values", 
     type = "l", 
     main = "Plots for exponential distribution")
lines(z, dexp(z,rate = 2), col="darkblue")
z1 <- rexp(1000,rate=2)
lines(ecdf(z1), col = "red")
```


## 3. Example: modelling a biased die   
   
```{r}
# n is the size of a sample
n <- 1000
# m is no. of repetitions
m <- 1000
# generating biased die throws
die_pr <- c(.1,.2,.2,.3,.1,.1)   # probabilities of throwing sides 1 to 6
diethrows <- sample(1:6, prob = die_pr, size = n, replace = T);
# summarise the results:
#diethrows

table(diethrows)
tabulate(diethrows)
# draw the histogram
hist(diethrows,
     probability = T,
     breaks = 6,
    #breaks = seq(0.5,6.6),
     main = paste("Histogram of the", n, "throws of a biased die"),
     col = "lightblue",
     xlab = "Values",
     xlim = c(0,7)
     )

```

## 3. Means and their visialisation:

```{r}
# means of diethrows; dtm ="diethrowmeans"
dtm <- replicate(m, mean(sample(1:6, prob = die_pr, size = n, replace = T)))
# theoretical expected value
length(dtm)
theorexp <- sum((1:6)*die_pr); theorexp; mean(dtm)
# theoretical variance
theorvar <- sum((1:6)^2*die_pr) - theorexp^2; theorvar/n; var(dtm)
# summary of dtm
summary(dtm)

# histogram
hist(dtm,
     probability = T,
     breaks = 30,
    #breaks = seq(0.5,6.6),
     main = paste("Means of n =", n, "throws of a biased die"),
     col = "lightblue",
     xlab = "Means",
     xlim = c(min(dtm),max(dtm))
     )
# superimpose normal distribution
x <- seq(min(dtm),max(dtm), by = .01)
lines(x, dnorm(x, mean = mean(dtm), sd = sd(dtm)), col ="red", lwd = 2)
```

## 4. Comparing the empirical and theoretical cdf

```{r}
# empirical cdf
plot(ecdf(dtm))
x <- seq(0,6,by=.01)
# superimposing the approximation by normal distribution due CLT
lines(x, pnorm(x, mean = mean(dtm), sd = sd(dtm)), col ="red", lwd = 2)
# how large is the difference?
max(abs(ecdf(dtm)(x)-pnorm(x, mean = mean(dtm), sd = sd(dtm))))
# does it agree with the LLN?
sum(abs(dtm - theorexp)>0.1)/m
```


## Task 2

1. Generate a sample of size 1000 combined from two samples of size 500 from the normal distributions N(mu,5) with mu = 0 and mu = 1 
2. Calculate sample mean, sample standard deviation and compare with the exact values
3. For q= 0.1,...,0.9 calculate sample q-percentiles manually 
  (i.e. by sorting the data and picking the corresponding values) and by using percentile
4. Compare with theoretical quantiles of that distribution
5. Check the k-sigma rule for k=1,2,3
6. Draw a histogram of the data
7. Draw the theoretical density
